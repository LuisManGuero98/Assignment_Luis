\section{Task 1}
\label{task1}

A mars explorer ground robot, namely nasa perseverance, is simulated leveraging the existing Gazebo environment from \href{https://github.com/AndrejOrsula/space_robotics_gz_envs.git}{Space Robotics Github}. 
The environment is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:env}.

\end{figure}

The simulated robot provides pose, odometry and velocity data through Gazebo topics. Similarly, it is controlled through linear and angular velocity commands sent to \textit{\/cmd\_vel} topic.
The velocities are constraint to $[-5, 5]$ and to $[-1, 1]$ for linear and angular velocities respectively.

Therefore, a circular path can be simulated by sending simultaneously linear and angular velocity commands.
